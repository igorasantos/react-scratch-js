# React app from scratch using JS

## What
This is a boilerplate created to help start projects of React apps from scratch based in JS.

## Why
The motivations to have done this boilerplate are:
- to avoid the abstractions that `create-react-app` does for us, when creating a new app project;
- ensure more awareness about what dependencies are being used and how are being setted up in the development environment.

## Sources
