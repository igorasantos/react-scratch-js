# React app from scratch using JS

## What
This is a boilerplate created to help start projects of React apps from scratch based in JS.

## Why
The motivations to have done this boilerplate are:
- to avoid the abstractions that `create-react-app` does for us, when creating a new app project;
- ensure more awareness about what dependencies are being used and how are being setted up in the development environment.

## Source
This boilerplate was made following the instructions on [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#creating-a-toolchain-from-scratch) and [this guide](https://blog.usejournal.com/creating-a-react-app-from-scratch-f3c693b84658).
